          The machine is reporting that it is not ready to communicate via ssh. Verify

        exe_not_in_host: |-
          The '%{executable}' executable file can't be found on the host machine but
          is required for sshfs mounting to work. Please install the software and 
          try again.
        sshfs_not_in_guest: |-
          The necessary SSHFS software is not installed in the guest. 
        install_failed_arch: |-
          The install of the sshfs client software failed. On Arch this is most likely
          because the package lists are not up to date [1] and partial upgrades are not
          supported [2]. Please update your Arch system or install SSHFS manually.

        normal_mount_failed: |-
          Mounting SSHFS shared folders failed. This is most often caused by either an

          Please make sure an SSH daemon is running on the host and proper credentials
          were provided to be able to authenticate via SSH.
