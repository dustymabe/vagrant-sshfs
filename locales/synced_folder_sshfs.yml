        install_failed_arch: |-
          The install of the sshfs client software failed. On Arch this is most likely
          because the package lists are not up to date [1] and partial upgrades are not
          supported [2]. Please update your Arch system or install SSHFS manually.

          Please make sure an SSH daemon is running on the host and proper credentials
          were provided to be able to authenticate via SSH.
